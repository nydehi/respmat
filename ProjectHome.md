# Automated analysis of invasive respiratory signals #

_This software has been developed under Matlab and offers a GUI to automatically process invasive respiratory signals (gastric and esophageal pressure) and provides Works of Breathing (WOB) in addition to other parameters._

## Quick Start ##
You can download the package here in[32bits](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8432389/RespMAT_pkg_32.exe) or [64bits](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8432389/RespMAT_pkg_64.exe). It may take up to an hour to download the file and this is because it contains the Matlab Runtime Componants (MRC). This component will have to be installed only once.

Once you have done so, if you want to update your version of the application, please see the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/respmat/downloads/list) page for the latter version of the executable.

## Documentation ##
Documentation is attached to the package. You can alternatively download it from the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/respmat/downloads/list) page.
